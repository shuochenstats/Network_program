The Group-level network inference (GLEN) package includes:
1. Matlab codes for l_0 norm regularized subgraph detection and graph combinatorics based statistical tests.

2. A live-script (which is matlab version of Rmarkdown) for GLEN anlaysis on a synthetic data (in the folder demo).
Please see the html file in the demo folder. 

3. Two live analysis for real data analysis. Please see the html files in the D1 and D2 folders. 


Note that the optimization is non-convex and may depend on the intitialization of the algorithms.
